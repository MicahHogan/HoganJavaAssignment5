PROJECT TITLE: WeatherManager
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: WeatherManager reads CSV files of weather data (each line containing one day's worth of weather data) of any length and creates WeatherDay objects. WeatherManager constructs an instanced object of Class weatherManager, which creates an array of instanced objects of Class weatherDay, which are composed of instanced objects of Class date and integer and double values. WeatherManager provides methods to return the number of weatherDays stored in the array, to return a weatherDay after passing it an index number, and to return an index number after passing it a date. WeatherManager can calculate the average high temperature, OR average low temperature, OR total precipitation after being passed the year and month. WeatherManager can calculate and return the rainiest month OR the longest period of time in which the average high temperature for the day increased, in days. @author Micah Hogan @version 03/10/20
